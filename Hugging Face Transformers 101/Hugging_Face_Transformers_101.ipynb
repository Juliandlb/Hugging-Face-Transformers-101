**Purpose**: Pipelines are designed for quick, easy, and high-level access to various NLP tasks like text classification, question answering, text generation, etc. They abstract away much of the complexity involved in setting up and using models and tokenizers.\n    - **Ease of Use**: Pipelines are user-friendly and require minimal code to get started. You don’t need to worry about loading models or tokenizers separately.\n    - **Flexibility**: Pipelines are less flexible since they are designed for specific tasks and operate within the constraints of the task-specific settings.\n    - **Customization**: Limited customization options. The parameters and the way data flows through the pipeline are predefined.\n    - **Ideal For**: Beginners, rapid prototyping, and tasks where you don’t need to fine-tune or customize the behavior of the models.\n\n\n2. **AutoModel/AutoTokenizer Classes**\n    - **Purpose**: These classes are more low-level and provide greater flexibility and control over the models and tokenizers. They allow you to load any pre-trained model or tokenizer from the model hub.\n    - **Ease of Use**: Requires more setup compared to pipelines. You need to explicitly load the tokenizer and model and handle the inputs and outputs manually.\n    - **Flexibility**: Highly flexible. You can customize almost every aspect of the model’s behavior, modify the data preprocessing, and tweak how the outputs are handled.\n    - **Customization**: Extensive customization options. You can fine-tune models, change tokenization strategies, modify model architecture, or integrate with other libraries for advanced use cases.\n    - **Ideal For**: Advanced users, research, fine-tuning models, and scenarios where you need to go beyond the default behavior of the pipelines.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pipelines\n\nThe [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines) is the easiest and fastest way to use a pretrained model for inference.
